# Helix Hop via Unity
I created the Helix Hop Game. 
The reason I choose Helix Hop Game is that Hyper Casual games are very trending and in high demand.
I used my own logic and strategy using help from video while I am building the game for the purpose of understanding and absorb every little detail in the developing process. So, that I can build a strong foundation and educate myself more about Unityâ€™s several tools.

# Details
Here is the logic behind the game. There is a ball and cylinder. Cylider is consists of several rings that involves safe and trap platforms. You need to get ball reach to the Finish Line by moving the cylinder using safe platforms and avoid the traps.  If ball hits the trap platform, game will over. Each time ball passes a ring you will get points. 
## I have created levels:

The game has UI screen that shows the total point, Next Level, Retry and Exit buttons.
